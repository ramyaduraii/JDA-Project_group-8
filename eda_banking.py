"""**Project on Exploratory Data Analysis for Banking Dataset**


**WHY THIS BANKING DATASET AND THE END RESULT**

**Problem:**
Customer closing their account frequently.How to fix?

**Solution:**
Focusing Customer Retention by giving promotion on High volumn job

**How**
In order to focus on increasing customers in our banking sector,as a analyst To Predict which job holder is opening bank account and using frequently in the year(around 12 months).

**Summary:**

1.   Analyze Dataset by seeing row and columns and column name.In 
our dataset we have** 42639 rows Ã— 17 columns** there.
2.   Next step is need to **preprocess the dataset**,in case if any null values or missing values or any duplicates or if any data is in unformatted way by using different function as **dropna(),drop duplicate(),isnull(),replace()** to **replace null value by mean(),mode(),or median()** or marked "unknown value".
3.   In this dataset it doesnt have any null/missing values/duplicate values.**Preprocessing done and shows nothing changed**.Its already in formatted structure.
4.   Need to see **total count of customer in each job** using **Value_counts()**.

5.   As a end result **9356 count of blue_collar(job)** customer as high account holder in the bank.
6.   We are showing the end result by using different visualization method as **bar chart,scatter chart and box plot**.
7.As a scatter plot shows that its a come under **positive correlation**
